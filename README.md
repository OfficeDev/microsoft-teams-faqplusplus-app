Chatbots are an easy way to provide answers to frequently asked questions by users. However, most chatbots fail to engage with users in meaningful way because there is no human in the loop when the chatbot fails.  

FAQ Plus bot is a friendly Q&A bot that brings a human in the loop when it is unable to help. One can ask the bot a question and the bot responds with an answer if it's in the knowledge base. If not, the bot allows the user to submit a query which then gets posted in a pre-configured team of experts who are help to provide support by acting upon the notifications from within their Team itself.
